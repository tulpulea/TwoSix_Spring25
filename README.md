### Some notes for this branch
- currently working on trying to unify database creation with modeling
- hence why this branch was sourced on scraping
- Some actions I'm taking:
    1) Updating env file: environment.yml was updated with specfic dependencies and more chromadb, removing unnecessary packages
    2) Implementing the database creation - potentially updating 
    scripts to also take care of seperate collection for policies
    3) Deciciding and implementing embeddings models & processes
    4) Setting up chromadb to store embeddings 
    5) Facilitating further modeling & visualization
