    "# Reg_API\n",
    "\n",
    "Singleton utility class for making API calls to [regulations.gov](regulations.gov). API calls are constructed by chaining method calls, eg; `api.endpoint(\"/comments\").search(\"climate\").get()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor takes 2 optional parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_size: int = 20` The number of results per page for paged results\n",
    "- `apikey: str = EMMAS_APIKEY` The api key used to validate results\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Each call should start with one of the following methods...\n",
    "\n",
    "- `endpoint(endpoint: str)` Start an api call at the specified `endpoint` as specified in the [API documentation](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/). This endpoint should start with a \"/\", eg; \"/comments\"\n",
    "- `url(url: string)`Start an api call at the specified `url`. Should include the api-base\n",
    "\n",
    "The following 2 methods can then be chained any number of times to limit search and/or get different pages\n",
    "\n",
    "- `search(search_term: str)` Only include results containing the `search_term`.\n",
    "- `page(page: int)` Get page number `page` of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each API call should be finished with the `get` method as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get(get_json: boolean=True)` Get the result of the constructed API call. If `get_json` is set to false, returns the full response object as returned by `requests.get`, otherwise just returns json content\n",
    "\n",
    "# CommentParser\n",
    "\n",
    "A singleton utility class used to get further data using pre-set API calls, extract data using pre-set field paths, and return a standardized dictionary containing the collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor takes a single required parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api: Reg_API` A `Reg_API` instance used to make additional API calls when needed \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comment Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of private methods used to define API calls and paths, but only the method `get_comment_data` should generally be called externally.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes a single required parameter `comment` which should be the data for a single comment. This data can be obtained by making a call to the \"/comments\" endpoint then accessing the \"data\" field of the returned dictionary and selecting one element of the array, eg `api.endpoint(\"/comments\").get()[\"data\"][0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this passed data the method several tasks to get and structure data related to the passed comment and returns the acquired info in a dictionary with the following keys...\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_id`: The comment ID, used to uniquely identify this comment within a MongoDB collection\n",
    "- `comment_response`: The dictionary passed to the method, contains basic info about the comment\n",
    "- `comment_info`: More detailed info about the comment obtained through an API call\n",
    "- `attachments`: Info about attachments obtained through an API call\n",
    "- `comment_text`: A custom dictionary containing the actual text of the comment. Has 2 keys for different sources of text\n",
    "    - `plaintext` The text in the \"comments\" field of the `comment_info` dictionary\n",
    "    - `attachments`: A list of the text in the attachments. Each entry is a dictionary where keys are filetypes and values are the text of the file, for example `{\"pdf\": \"This is the text of a PDF Comment\"}`.\n",
    "      > Note: Currently this *only* handles pdf files, which appear to be the only filetype despite the returned json having a field formatted like `\"fileFormats\": [urls]` which suggessts the posssibility of multiple file formats.\n"
